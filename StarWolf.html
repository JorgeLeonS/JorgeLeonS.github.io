							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<p>
								Consists in a space based game, where the player constantly moves forward while avoiding and/or shooting different objects such as inmobile mines, and space debris, but also following enemies. The movement mechanics is based on the game Starfox.
							</p>
							<h2>Repo:

							</h2>
							<h2>What does it have?</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Single and Multiplayer mode through UNet Networking (The same level is used in both modes but object instancing number is reduced in Multiplayer for better performance).
								</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/StarWolf/DemoImage2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A Cinemachine Dolly Cart is implemented to keep a constant forward movement, limiting X and Y with the camera view
								</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/StarWolf/DemoImage3.png" alt="" /></span>
							<ul>	
								<li>
									Instancing for different objects within an specified area, where every object type is assigned: 
									<ul>
										<li>
											A random size in a range of values.
										</li>
										<li>
											A different damage if the player collides.
										</li>
										<li>
											Five levels of detail, reducing the polygon count for each object depending on the distance to the player.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/StarWolf/DemoImage1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The following enemy guides itself to the player with a Finite State Machine: 
									<ul>
										<li>
											A Mesh Filter is positioned in the level, checking on each Update the player's position, assigning an approximate value to the texture, so the enemy can find the player.
										</li>
										<li>
											The player's position in the mesh can be seen with a Mesh Filter texture color, but it's disabled so as not to interfere with sight.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/StarWolf/DemoImage4.png" alt="" /></span>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The Mines that automatically end the game when the player collides with them are Tessellated octahedrons. 
									<ul>
										<li>
											The octahedron is modeled inside the script with vertex, faces and connections.
										</li>
										<li>
											It is tessellated 4 times, so it has the appearance of a sphere.
										</li>
										<li>
											5 spikes are randomly generated for each sphere with normalized vectors.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/StarWolf/DemoImage5.png" alt="" /></span>
							<ul>
								<li>
									A rear view that shows when the player hits "3". It's a Render Texture that's positioned behind the player. When it's activated, the ship will also shoot backwards.
								</li>
							</ul>
