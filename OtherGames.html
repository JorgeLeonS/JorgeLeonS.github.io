							<h1 class="major">1. Geometry Guars</h1>
							<p>

							</p>
							<ul>
								<li> Three types of enemies (slow, regular and fast) randomly spawned with Gizmos with a safe distance form player. </li>
								<li> A particle system that shows when either a bullet or the player collides with an enemy. </li>
								<li> Difficulty (enemy spawning speed) increases exponentially according to an animation curve. </li>
								<li> The glow in enemies, player, bullets and the pattern was applied through the default unity shaders. </li>
								<li> The player movement is controlled by the acceleration and turning speed. </li>
								<li> The bullets are spawned in a different roation depending on the clicked arrow. </li>
							</ul>

							<p>

										<li> Player 2 moves with arrow keys, jumps with Right CTRL and shoots with Right Shift. </li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li> The platform is infinite, which means that if a player goes out of the bounds in either X or Y, it will reappear on the other side. </li>
								<li> Players have a double jump, allowing to go higher or further, also used to wall jump. </li>
								<li> Arrows will stick to the map, allowing players to grab them, and carry maximum 5. </li>
								<li>
									Different behaviours for the platforms, such as: 
									<ul>
										<li> Moving </li>
										<li> Rotating </li>
										<li> Climbable (Wall Jump) </li>
										<li> Non walkable (The top part of the climbable walls) </li>
