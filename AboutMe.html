							<h2>Experience and interests:</h2>
							<p>
								I have a degree in Computer Science from the Instituto Tencológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, México City campus where I graduated in December 2020.
								There, I started to get to know about game and VR development. I have some older projects I did back then, which might be somewhere to be found on my

							<p>
								I had the oportunity to attend to an intensive 1 month Game Design and programming at Vancouver Film School on 2019, and it became one of my goals to be able to study a full program since then.
								I then started the VR and AR design and development program on 2022 and loved it.

							<h2>On some more personal stuff...</h2>
							<p>Although I really like to spend my time playing a game, or watching series, anime and movies, I'm also a very nature lover guy, I love to go out walking, hiking and exploring on different environments that cath my eye.
							I love to share those experiences with anyone that is also interested in that.</p>
							<p>I love México, but ever since I had the opportunity to live in Canada, I found a lot of new interests and set my goal to live here.</p>
